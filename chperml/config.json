	"description": "Allow / disallow a certian user from using a command. This will take precedence over the default permissions of a command or ones set with `{{prefix}}chmodl`. Use it like `{{prefix}}chperml cat Someuser 0`. That would ban Someuser from using `{{prefix}}cat`. Change last `0` to `1` for when you want to allow instead of ban them from using the command, and change `cat` to the desired command."
